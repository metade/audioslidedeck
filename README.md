# Audio Slide Deck

Audio Slide Deck is a mobile application that jornalists/bloggers can use on the move to create and publish audio slideshows to their blogs and websites.

It pulls in audio from AudioBoo and images from Flickr.

## Motivation

High quality video content is expensive to produce and difficult to upload from the field, especially if journalists or bloggers are in developing countries or remote areas where there is poor internet connectivity.

Audio on the other hand is far cheaper to produce and easier to upload as the file sizes are far smaller. By adding an image slideshow to the audio stream, it's possible to tell compelling stories. For example, listen to this short piece by @documentally about the #GSxSW:

## Mobile Application

The mobile app is implemented in JQuery Mobile and it can be accessed here: [http://audioslidedeck.heroku.com/](http://audioslidedeck.heroku.com/)

## Slideshow

The slideshow is implemented in HTML+JS so it can work on all platforms.
